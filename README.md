> A stage-based Azure DevOps pipeline for migrating repositories from Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise at scale. Supports batch migrations, automated validation, pipeline rewiring, and Azure Boards integration.

## 🎯 Migration Challenges at Enterprise Scale

Enterprise-scale repository migration from Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise is a multi-stage process that includes readiness validation, repository migration, post-migration verification, pipeline rewiring, and Azure Boards integration. When applied to thousands of repositories, this process becomes difficult to coordinate, error-prone, and hard to scale using ad-hoc scripts or centralized execution models.

This pipeline addresses those challenges through a staged, self-service migration model. Instead of relying on a single central team, individual product teams can migrate their own repositories using a standardized Azure DevOps YAML pipeline that orchestrates the entire lifecycle. This approach reduces operational bottlenecks, limits blast radius, and enforces consistency across all migrations.

At enterprise scale, this pipeline overcomes the following challenges:

- ⏱️ Serial execution does not scale for thousands of repositories
- 🚦 Centralized migration teams become bottlenecks
- ⚠️ All-at-once migrations increase risk and blast radius
- 🔍 Manual validation leads to errors and inconsistencies
- 📊 Tracking partial success and failures is operationally complex

## 📋 Pipeline Execution Model

> ℹ️ **Informational Only**  
> This section is provided for **conceptual understanding** of the pipeline flow.
> Actual execution behavior is governed by the YAML implementation.

This pipeline orchestrates a **six-stage sequential migration process** from Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise. Each stage runs on a **Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agent** (`ubuntu-latest`).

### Key Features

**Partial Success:**  
Stage 3 (Repository Migration) publishes a `repos_with_status.csv` artifact that tracks which repositories migrated successfully and which failed. Stages 4-6 consume this artifact and execute **only against successfully migrated repositories**.

Stage 5 (Pipeline Rewiring) has additional logic: it reads pipeline definitions from `pipelines.csv`, then cross-references with `repos_with_status.csv` to ensure rewiring only occurs for repositories that migrated successfully.

**Manual Approval Gate:**  
After Stage 2 (Pre-migration Check), the pipeline pauses for manual approval. This allows you to review the readiness report—which identifies active pull requests and running pipelines—before proceeding with migration. The approval gate has a 3-day timeout and auto-rejects if not approved.

**Stage Dependencies:**  
Stages 1-3 require strict success (`condition: succeeded()`). Stages 4-6 tolerate partial failures and will execute even if the previous stage completes with issues (`condition: in(...result, 'Succeeded', 'SucceededWithIssues')`).

> **Technical Note:** Since Ubuntu runners do not persist state between stages, the pipeline uses artifacts for cross-stage continuity.

### Stage Execution Details

Each stage executes a specific script and generates detailed logs. Stages 4-6 automatically process only repositories that migrated successfully in Stage 3.

### Stage 1: Prerequisite Validation
Performs validation checks to:

- Verify `bash/repos.csv` exists and is not empty
- Validate required CSV columns: `org`, `teamproject`, `repo`, `github_org`, `github_repo`, `gh_repo_visibility`
- Display repository count for the migration batch
- **⚠️ Note:** `pipelines.csv` is validated in Stage 5, not Stage 1. Ensure it's properly formatted before running the pipeline.

### Stage 2: Pre-Migration Check
Executes `1_pr_pipeline_check.sh` to:

- Detects active builds, release pipelines, and pull requests
- Identifies potential blockers before migration begins
- Generates a readiness report

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The pipeline pauses here for manual approval. Review the readiness report to ensure no active PRs or running pipelines exist before proceeding to Stage 3. Timeout: 3 days (auto-rejects if not approved).

### Stage 3: Repository Migration
Executes `2_migration.sh` to:

- Perform parallel migrations (configurable: 1-5 concurrent via `maxConcurrent` parameter)
- Migrate repository content, branches, and commit history
- Create `repos_with_status.csv` tracking success/failure for each repository
- Publish artifact for downstream stages

**📺 [Watch: Repository Migration Demo](media/migration_demo.mp4)**
-->

### Stage 4: Repository Migration Validation
Executes `3_post_migration_validation.sh` (operates on successfully migrated repos only) to:

- Compare branch counts between ADO and GitHub repositories
- Verify commit counts match for each branch
- Validate latest commit SHAs to ensure complete migration
- Generate validation logs

### Stage 5: Pipeline Rewiring
Executes `4_rewire_pipeline.sh` (operates on successfully migrated repos only) to:

- Read pipeline definitions from `pipelines.csv`
- Cross-reference with `repos_with_status.csv` to filter successful migrations
- Rewire Azure DevOps pipelines to point to GitHub repositories
- Validate GitHub service connection availability

-->

### Stage 6: Azure Boards Integration
Executes `5_boards_integration.sh` (operates on successfully migrated repos only) to:

- Validate GitHub and ADO PAT token scopes
- Integrate Azure Boards with migrated GitHub repositories
- Enable AB# work item linking in commits and pull requests

### Required Setup

Complete these steps before your first pipeline run:

#### 1. 🗂️ CSV Configuration Files

Edit two CSV template files in the `bash/` directory to define your migration scope:

**`bash/repos.csv`** - Repositories to migrate

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `org` | Azure DevOps organization name |
| `teamproject` | Azure DevOps project name |
| `repo` | Azure DevOps repository name |
| `github_org` | Target GitHub organization |
| `github_repo` | Target GitHub repository name |
| `gh_repo_visibility` | `private`, `public`, or `internal` |

**`bash/pipelines.csv`** - Pipelines to rewire (Stage 5)

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `org` | Azure DevOps organization name |
| `teamproject` | Azure DevOps project name |
| `repo` | Azure DevOps repository name (cross-references with repos.csv) |
| `pipeline` | Pipeline name/path (e.g., `\my-pipeline-ci`) |
| `url` | Pipeline URL (for reference) |
| `serviceConnection` | GitHub service connection ID (see Prerequisite #4) |
| `github_org` | Target GitHub organization |
| `github_repo` | Target GitHub repository name |

> **💡 Tip**: You can migrate in batches by including only a subset of repositories in each CSV file.

---

#### 2. 🔐 Authentication Tokens

Create **3 PAT tokens** with the following scopes:

**GitHub PAT #1 - Migration (Stages 1-5):**
- ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
- ✅ `admin:org` (Full control of orgs and teams)
- ✅ `read:user` (Read user profile data)

**GitHub PAT #2 - Boards Integration (Stage 6 only):**
- ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- ✅ `admin:repo_hook` (Full control of repository hooks)
- ✅ `read:user` (Read user profile data)
- ✅ `user:email` (Access user email addresses)

**Azure DevOps PAT:**
- **Recommended**: `Full access` / Admin scope (simplest option)
- **Alternative**: Use minimum required scopes (see below)

<details>
<summary>📋 Minimum Required ADO PAT Scopes (click to expand)</summary>

- ✅ `Analytics` (Read)
- ✅ `Build` (Read)
- ✅ `Code` (Read, Full, Status)
- ✅ `GitHub Connections` (Read & manage)
- ✅ `Graph` (Read)
- ✅ `Identity` (Read)
- ✅ `Pipeline Resources` (Use)
- ✅ `User Profile` (Read)
- ✅ `Project and Team` (Read)
- ✅ `Release` (Read)
- ✅ `Security` (Manage)
- ✅ `Service Connections` (Read & query)
- ✅ `Work Items` (Read)

</details>

---

#### 3. 🧩 GitHub Service Connection

Create a GitHub service connection in Azure DevOps:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Service connections**
2. Create new **GitHub** connection (choose "GitHub App" for best security)
3. Grant **Contributor** permissions on target GitHub org/repos
4. Copy the service connection ID (GUID)
5. Add ID to `serviceConnection` column in `bash/pipelines.csv`

**Example:**
```csv
serviceConnection
3dfa8dac-601c-4b68-a4eb-29737c5ebf04
```

[Learn more about service connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints)

---

#### 4. 🔐 Variable Groups

Store your PAT tokens (from Prerequisite #2) in two Azure DevOps Variable Groups:

**Variable Group #1:** `core-entauto-github-migration-secrets` (Stages 1-6)

| Variable | Value | Used In |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `GH_PAT` | GitHub PAT #1 (migration scopes) | Stages 1-5 |
| `ADO_PAT` | Azure DevOps PAT | All stages |

**Variable Group #2:** `azure-boards-integration-secrets` (Stage 6 additional)

| Variable | Value | Used In |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `GH_PAT` | GitHub PAT #2 (boards scopes) | Stage 6 only |
| `ADO_PAT` | Azure DevOps PAT (same as Group #1) | Stage 6 |

> **Note:** Both variable groups must exist before running the pipeline. If you use different names, update the YAML file accordingly.

---

### Optional Configurations

#### 5. 🧪 Demo Mode

Test the migration process without post-migration stages (Validation, Rewiring, Boards Integration).

**Enable Demo Mode:**
Select `runDemoRepoMigration: true` when prompted in the Azure DevOps pipeline run dialog.

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Runs Stages 1-3 (Prerequisites, Pre-migration Check, Migration)
- ❌ Skips Stages 4-6 (Validation, Rewiring, Boards Integration)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL - Demo Mode Limitations:**
> - Repositories **ARE migrated** to GitHub (NOT a dry-run simulation)
> - Stages 4-6 are **skipped**
> - **Rollback requires manual deletion** of migrated GitHub repositories
> - **Only use non-production/test repositories**

**Rollback (if needed):**
```bash
# Navigate to GitHub repository settings
# https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/settings
# Scroll to "Danger Zone" → "Delete this repository"
```

   ```

3. **Commit and push changes**
   ```bash
   git add bash/repos.csv bash/pipelines.csv
   git commit -m "Configure migration batch: test repositories"
   git push
   ```

4. **Set up the pipeline in Azure DevOps** (first-time only)
   
   **If pipeline doesn't exist:**
   - Navigate to `https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<project>` → **Pipelines** → **New Pipeline**
   - Select your repository source (Azure Repos/GitHub)
   - Choose **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file** → Select `ado2gh-migration.yml`
   - Click **Save** or **Run**
   
   **If pipeline already exists:**
   - Go to **Pipelines** → Select the migration pipeline → Click **Run pipeline**

5. **Configure pipeline parameters**
   
   In the "Run pipeline" dialog, configure:
   
   **For test/first runs:**
   - Check the box: "Demo Mode: Run Migration Only (Skip Stage 4-6)"
   - `maxConcurrent`: **`1`** (migrate one repo at a time)
   
   **For production runs:**
   - Uncheck "Demo Mode" (runs all 6 stages)
   - `maxConcurrent`: **`3-5`** (based on your needs)
   
   Click **Run** to start the pipeline.

6. **Monitor pipeline execution**
   
   | Stage | Key Actions | Expected Outcome |
   |-------|-------------|------------------|
   | **Stage 1: Prerequisite Validation** | View logs to verify CSV validation | ✅ "X repositories found" message |
   | **Stage 2: Pre-migration Check** | Download `readiness-logs` artifact | ✅ No active PRs or running pipelines |
   | **🔒 Manual Approval Gate** | Review readiness report, then **APPROVE** or **REJECT** | ✅ Approval granted (timeout: 3 days) |
   | **Stage 3: Repository Migration** | Monitor logs, check `repos_with_status.csv` artifact | ✅ Migration completes (success/partial) |
   | **Stage 4: Migration Validation** | Download `validation-logs`, check ✅/❌ indicators | ✅ Branch counts, commits, SHAs match |
   | **Stage 5: Pipeline Rewiring** | Download `rewiring-logs`, verify GitHub connection | ✅ Pipelines point to GitHub repos |
   | **Stage 6: Boards Integration** | Download `boards-integration-logs`, test AB#123 | ✅ Work item linking active |

7. **Verify migration success**
   
   **Automated validation (Stage 4):**
   - Branch counts match between ADO and GitHub
   - Commit counts match for all branches
   - Latest commit SHAs match
   
   **Manual verification:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the migrated repository
   git clone https://github.com/<github_org>/<github_repo>.git
   cd <github_repo>
   
   # Verify branches exist
   git branch -a
   
   # Check commit history
   git log --oneline
   
   ```
   
   **Post-migration cleanup:**
   - Disable ADO repository to prevent accidental commits (see [FAQ Q2](#q2-what-happens-to-the-ado-repository-after-migration))
   - Update team documentation with new GitHub repository URLs
   - Notify stakeholders of the migration

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Can multiple teams run this pipeline simultaneously?

**A:** Yes, **if migrating different repositories**.

**Best Practices:**
- Coordinate migration schedules across teams
- Use separate CSV files per team with **zero repository overlap**
- Ensure each repository appears in only one team's CSV file
- If uncertain, run migrations sequentially to avoid conflicts


### Q2: What happens to the ADO repository after migration?

**A:** The ADO repository remains **intact and unchanged**. Migration is a **copy operation**, not a move.
> **💡 Tip**: After confirming migration success, manually disable the ADO repository to prevent accidental commits.


### Q3: Can I migrate repositories from multiple ADO organizations?

**A:** Yes, but you need **separate ADO PAT tokens** for each organization.

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Create a **separate ADO PAT token for each organization**
- ✅ The pipeline currently supports **one ADO organization per run**
- ✅ To migrate from multiple orgs, run the pipeline **separately for each organization**


### Q4: How long does a typical migration take?

**A:** Highly variable based on repository size and batch size.

### Q5: Can I skip Stage 5 (Pipeline Rewiring) if I don't have pipelines?

**A:** No, you cannot skip stages. However, you can provide an **empty `pipelines.csv`** file with just the header row.

**Empty pipelines.csv:**

```csv
org,teamproject,repo,pipeline,url,serviceConnection,github_org,github_repo
```

### Q6: Does this pipeline migrate pull requests?

**A:** No, **pull requests are NOT migrated**.

**What Happens to PRs:**
- ❌ Active PRs in ADO will NOT be transferred to GitHub
- ⚠️ Stage 2 (Pre-migration Check) will **warn if active PRs exist**
- ✅ You must **complete, merge, or abandon PRs** before migration

**Recommendation:**
- Complete all active PRs before migration
- Or manually recreate PRs in GitHub after migration

### Q7: Can I migrate private ADO repos to public GitHub repos?

**A:** Yes, use `gh_repo_visibility: public` in repos.csv.


### Q8: What happens if migration fails halfway through?

**A:** The pipeline **continues processing successfully migrated repositories**. Stages 4-6 run only for repos that migrated successfully.

**How Partial Failures Work:**
- ✅ Stage 3 completes with **"Succeeded with issues"** status
- ✅ `repos_with_status.csv` tracks which repos succeeded/failed
- ✅ Stages 4-6 automatically skip failed repos and process only successful ones
- ✅ Pipeline completes all stages for successful repositories

### Q9: How do I validate that migration was successful?

**A:** Use the automated validation in **Stage 4**, plus manual verification
